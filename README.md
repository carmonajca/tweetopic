# TweeTopic

:zap: Blazing Fast implementation of the Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Mixture Model for topic modelling over short texts utilizing the power of :1234: Numpy and :snake: Numba.
<br>The package uses the Movie Group Process algorithm described in Yin and Wang (2014).

## Installation

The package might be released on PIP in the future, for now you can install it directly from Github with the following command:
<br>
`pip install git+https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/tweetopic`

## Usage

To create a model you should import `MovieGroupProcess` from the package:

```python
from tweetopic import MovieGroupProcess

# Creating a model with 30 clusters
mgp = MovieGroupProcess(n_clusters=30, alpha=0.1, beta=0.1)
```

You may fit the model with a stream of short texts:

```python
mgp.fit(
    texts,
    n_iterations=1000, # You may specify the number of iterations
    max_df=0.1, # As well as parameters for the vectorizer.
    min_df=15
)
```

To examine the structure of the clusters you can either look at the most frequently occuring words:

```python
mgp.top_words(top_n=3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[
    {'vaccine': 1011.0, 'coronavirus': 428.0, 'vaccines': 396.0},
    {'afghanistan': 586.0, 'taliban': 509.0, 'says': 464.0},
    {'man': 362.0, 'prison': 310.0, 'year': 288.0},
    {'police': 567.0, 'floyd': 444.0, 'trial': 393.0},
    {'media': 331.0, 'twitter': 321.0, 'facebook': 306.0},
    ...
    {'pandemic': 432.0, 'year': 427.0, 'new': 422.0},
    {'election': 759.0, 'trump': 573.0, 'republican': 527.0},
    {'women': 91.0, 'heard': 84.0, 'depp': 76.0}
]
```

Or use rich visualizations provided by pyLDAvis:

```python
mgp.visualize()
```

## Limitations

TweeTopic is so efficient and fast, as it exploits the fact that it's only short texts, we want to cluster. The number of unique terms in any document _MUST_ be less than 256.
Additionally any term in any document may at most appear 255 times.
<br>As of now, this requirement is not enforced by the package, please be aware of this, as it might cause strange behaviour.

> Note: If it is so demanded, this restriction could be relaxed, make sure to file an issue, if you intend to use TweeTopic for longer texts.
